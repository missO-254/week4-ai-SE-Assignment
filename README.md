# Week 4 - AI in Software Engineering

## Overview
This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied in software engineering to automate repetitive tasks, improve software quality, and support data-driven decision-making.  

It covers three main areas â€” **AI-powered code completion**, **automated testing**, and **predictive analytics**, followed by an ethical reflection on AI fairness.

## Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Key insights:
- AI-driven tools like GitHub Copilot reduce development time by automating code suggestions, though they can occasionally produce insecure or inefficient code.
- Supervised learning identifies known bug patterns, while unsupervised learning clusters new, unseen ones.
- Bias mitigation ensures personalized software experiences remain fair and inclusive.
- AIOps improves deployment pipelines through predictive alerts and anomaly detection.

## Part 2: Practical Implementation

### Task 1 â€” AI-Powered Code Completion
Compared AI-generated and manual implementations of a Python sorting function.
- **Result:** AI version was faster to produce, manual version handled missing data more safely.

### Task 2 â€” Automated Testing with AI
Simulated automated login tests showing how AI improves test coverage by predicting likely user paths and automatically generating edge cases.

### Task 3 â€” Predictive Analytics for Resource Allocation
Used the **Breast Cancer Dataset** and trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict issue priority levels (Low, Medium, High).  
- **Accuracy:** ~90%
- **F1-score:** Strong macro average  
Demonstrates how ML can be applied to optimize resource allocation in software teams.

## Part 3: Ethical Reflection
Discussed how biases in datasets can affect fairness in AI systems.  
Proposed using **IBM AI Fairness 360** for bias detection and mitigation, ensuring responsible deployment in real-world engineering workflows.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
- **Google Colab**
- **GitHub Copilot / AI-assisted code completion**
- **Matplotlib** (for visualization)
- **Random Forest Classifier**


## Deliverables
- `Week4_AI_in_Software_Engineering.ipynb` â€“ Full notebook with code & outputs  
- `Report_AI_in_Software_Engineering.pdf` â€“ Theory, screenshots, ethical reflection
